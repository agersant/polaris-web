# Setup

The first thing you need to start iterating on the Polaris web interface is a working Polaris executable. You can either use your existing Polaris installation, or compile your own by following [this guide](https://github.com/agersant/polaris/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). Once you have a working Polaris installation, you're almost done! Here is what comes after:

1. Clone the polaris-web repository with `git clone https://github.com/agersant/polaris-web.git`
2. Run Polaris with the `-w` flag indicating where your polaris-web repository is. For example on Windows using your existing Polaris installation, you would run this command: `polaris.exe -w C:/path/to/polaris-web`
3. Do some work in your polaris-web directory
4. Access [http://localhost:5050/](http://localhost:5050/) to see the Web UI and look at your changes!
